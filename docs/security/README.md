# QuantumSafe Finance Security Guide

## Security Overview

QuantumSafe Finance is designed with security as the primary concern. This document outlines the security architecture, implementation details, and best practices for using the library securely.

## Security Architecture

### 1. Core Security Features

- **Memory Safety**: Implemented in Rust with memory safety guarantees
- **No-std Support**: Can run in environments without standard library
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Prevents timing attacks
- **Secure Key Management**: Secure key generation and storage
- **Side-Channel Protection**: Resistant to side-channel attacks

### 2. Cryptographic Security

- **Post-Quantum Algorithms**: Implements NIST-approved PQC algorithms
- **Key Encapsulation**: Kyber (KEM)
- **Digital Signatures**: Dilithium, Falcon, SPHINCS+
- **Secure Randomness**: Cryptographically secure random number generation

### 3. Implementation Security

- **Memory Management**: Safe memory allocation and deallocation
- **Zeroing on Drop**: Sensitive data zeroed before deallocation
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Prevents timing attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling
