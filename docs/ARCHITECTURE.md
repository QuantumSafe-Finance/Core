# QuantumSafe Finance Architecture

## Overview

QuantumSafe Finance is designed as a modular quantum-resistant cryptography solution for financial applications. The architecture is divided into several key components:

### Core Components

1. **Crypto Engine**
   - Implemented in Rust for performance and safety
   - Uses PQCrypto library for quantum-safe algorithms
   - Supports multiple post-quantum cryptography schemes

2. **Language Bindings**
   - C bindings for interoperability
   - Python bindings for ease of use
   - TypeScript bindings for web applications

3. **Security Layer**
   - Key management system
   - Secure key exchange protocols
   - Quantum-resistant signature schemes

### Integration Points

- Financial applications
- Blockchain implementations
- Secure communication protocols

## Security Considerations

- Key size and performance trade-offs
- Algorithm selection criteria
- Side-channel attack prevention
- Random number generation

## Future Extensions

- Additional quantum-safe algorithms
- Hardware acceleration support
- Advanced key management features
