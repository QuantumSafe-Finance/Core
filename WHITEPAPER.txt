QuantumSafe Finance

1. Overview

QuantumSafe Finance is a hybrid Open-Core platform designed to enable seamless adoption of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and intelligent auditing for financial institutions. Our mission is to help banks, fintechs, payment gateways, and other financial services gradually migrate to quantum-resistant algorithms without sacrificing performance, security, or regulatory compliance.

2. Value Proposition

* Trust & Transparency: The open-source core allows independent audit by customers and regulators, building confidence.
* Market Differentiator: The first framework that combines a mature PQC engine with an ML-driven intelligent audit module.
* Plug-&-Play Integration: Transparent TLS sidecar upgrade, multi-language bindings (Rust, Python, Java, Go, C/C++), and minimal code changes.
* Scalability & Performance: Kubernetes-native design supports fault-tolerant clusters and sub-1ms latency for critical cryptographic operations.
* Flexible Monetization: Core released under MIT/Apache license; proprietary Enterprise modules available under commercial license with SLA options.
